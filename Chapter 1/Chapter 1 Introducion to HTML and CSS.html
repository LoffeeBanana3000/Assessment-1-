        Edible cookie dough is safe to eat, sweet, and delicious! It's like eating real cookie dough, 
        without raw eggs and raw flour, so you can eat it by the spoonful or dip it with your favorite snacks. 
        This edible cookie dough recipe is so easy to make because it only has a few ingredients 
        and it takes minutes to come together.

        <h2><span>Ingredients:</span></h2>

        <ul>     
            <li> Flour: Raw all-purpose flour can cause foodborne illness, so you’ll have to heat-treat it before adding it to the dough. Find heat-treating instructions in Step 1 of the recipe. </li>
            <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar lends a sweet, warm flavor. </li>
            <li>Butter: Beat the brown sugar with a stick of butter. </li>
            <li>Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the flavor of the edible cookie dough.</li>
            <li> Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make the edible cookie dough taste salty.</li>
            <li>Milk: Milk adds moisture and helps create the perfect texture. </li>
            <li> Chocolate chips: Use a blend of semisweet and mini chocolate chips for the perfect cookie dough experience.</li>
        </ul>
<!--unordered lists for the list of ingredients-->
