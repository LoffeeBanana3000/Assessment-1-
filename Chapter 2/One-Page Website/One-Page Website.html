    <h1 class="Brown"> Minecraft:"Shape your world" </h1>
            
    <h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Minecraft is a game made up of blocks, creatures, and community. You can survive the night or build a work of art – the choice is all yours. But if the thought of exploring a vast new world all on your own feels overwhelming, then fear not! Let’s explore what Minecraft is all about!</p>
    
    <h2 class="h2">What is the Goal of Minecraft </h2>
        <p>Minecraft has no set goal and can be played however you’d like! This is why it’s sometimes called a “sandbox game” – there are lots of things for you to do, and lots of ways that you can play. If you like being creative, then you can use the blocks to build things from your imagination. If you’re feeling brave, you can explore the world and face daring challenges. Blocks can be broken, crafted, placed to reshape the landscape, or used to build fantastical creations. </p>
        <p>Creatures can be battled or befriended, depending on how you play. The world of Minecraft allows for epic adventures, quiet meditations, and everything in between. You can even share your creations with other players, or play in community worlds!</p>
    
    <h2 class="h2">What is the target age for Minecraft?</h2>
        <p>Minecraft has a recommended PEGI rating of 7 and an ESBR rating of Everyone 10+. Don’t worry – grownups are welcome, too!</p>
    
    <h2 class="h2"> Is Minecraft Violent?</h2>
        <p>Because combat is part of the game, there are some elements of mild violence. Players can hit and defeat both passive and hostile mobs, as well as other players if playing in multiplayer mode. However, the graphical violence is limited by Minecraft’s visual style and there’s no blood.  When it comes to unwanted player violence like griefing, Mojang encourages players to report griefing behavior.</p>
    
    <h2 class="h2"> What Platforms is Minecraft available on?</h2>
        <p>Minecraft is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, Xbox One, Xbox Series S and X, PlayStation 4 and 5, Nintendo Switch, Fire OS/TV, Android, iOS, Windows Mobile, and Samsung Gear VR.</p>
    
    <h2 class="h2">The Different Gamemodes in Minecraft</h2>
        <p>Minecraft has two standard game modes – Creative mode and Survival mode. </p>
        <p>In Creative mode, you have unlimited resources, immortality, the ability to fly, as well as the ability to destroy any kind of block instantly. This mode is mostly used by players who want to focus on the sheer pleasure of creating things with blocks. </p>
        <p>In Survival mode, you explore the world, collect resources, craft, fight monsters, and gain experience points. Breaking different blocks takes work and requires specific tools. You are also bound by gravity and must manage your own hunger and health. Survival mode in Minecraft: Java Edition also has a sub-category mode called “Hardcore” in which you only get one life – lose it and it’s game over.</p>
        <p>Creative and Survival both have four difficulty settings: Peaceful, Easy, Normal, and Hard. In Creative mode these settings don’t matter very much, because mobs won’t attack you. In Survival mode however, these difficulty settings are very important! They affect a number of factors, such as how often hostile mobs will spawn, how much damage they do, how quickly the hunger bar is depleted, and how fast a player’s health replenishes over time. </p>
        <p>In addition to these game modes, there’s also unique content created by the Minecraft community in the form of hand-crafted worlds, mini-games, mash-up packs, adventure maps, and much more. This content can be found in Bedrock Edition at Minecraft Marketplace or via the subscription service Realms Plus, as well as Java Realms (Java Edition).</p>

    <h1 class="Brown">Who Made Minecraft?</h1>
        <p>Minecraft is a 2011 sandbox game developed and published by Swedish video game developer <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojang_Studios" target ="_blank">Mojang Studios.</a>  Originally created by <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson" target ="_blank"> Marcus "Notch" Persson</a>  using the Java programming language, the first public alpha build was released on 17 May 2009. </p>
        <p>The game was continuously developed from then on, receiving a full release on 18 November 2011. Afterwards, Persson left Mojang and gave <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Bergensten" target ="_blank">Jens "Jeb" Bergensten </a> control over development. In the years since its release, it has been ported to several platforms, including smartphones, tablets, and various video game consoles. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft" target ="_blank">Microsoft</a> for US$2.5 billion.</p>

    <h1 class="Brown">Gameplay</h1>
        <p>Minecraft is a 3D sandbox video game that has no required goals to accomplish, allowing players a large amount of freedom in choosing how to play the game.The game also features an optional achievement system.Gameplay is in the first-person perspective by default, but players have the option of a second and third-person perspective.The game world is composed of rough 3D objects—mainly cubes, referred to as blocks—representing various materials, such as dirt, stone, ores, tree trunks, water, and lava. The core gameplay revolves around picking up and placing these objects. These blocks are arranged in a 3D grid, while players can move freely around the world. Players can break, or mine, blocks and then place them elsewhere, enabling them to build things.The game also contains a material called redstone, which can be used to make primitive mechanical devices, electrical circuits, and logic gates, allowing for the construction of many complex systems. Many commentators have described the game's physics system as unrealistic.</p>
       
        <p>Players can also craft a wide variety of items, such as armor, which mitigates damage from attacks; weapons (such as swords or axes), which allows monsters and animals to be killed more easily; and tools (such as pickaxes or shovels), which break certain types of blocks more quickly. Some items have multiple tiers depending on the material used to craft them, with higher-tier items being more effective and durable. They may also freely construct helpful blocks—such as furnaces which can cook food and smelt ores, and torches that produce light—or exchange items with a villager (NPC) through trading emeralds for different goods and vice versa.The game has an inventory system, allowing players to carry a limited number of items.</p>
    
        <p> The game world is virtually infinite and procedurally generated as players explore it, using a map seed that is obtained from the system clock at the time of world creation (or manually specified by the player). While there are limits on the world's verticality, Minecraft allows an infinitely large game world to be generated on the horizontal plane, up to 30 million blocks from the world's center. The game achieves this by splitting the world data into smaller 16-by-16 sections called chunks that are created or loaded only when players are nearby. The world is divided into biomes ranging from deserts to jungles to snowfields;  the terrain includes plains, mountains, forests, caves, and bodies of water or lava. The in-game time system follows a day and night cycle, with one full cycle lasting for 20 real-time minutes. </p>
